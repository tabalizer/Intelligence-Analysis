## ⚖️ **Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) Cheat Sheet**  

### 📌 **What is ACH?**  
Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) is a **structured analytical technique** used to **objectively evaluate multiple hypotheses** by testing **all available evidence** against them. It helps reduce **cognitive bias, premature conclusions, and confirmation bias**.  

### 🎯 **Purpose**  
- Avoid **bias & premature conclusions** 🚫  
- Ensure **objective analysis** 🔍  
- Identify **weak & strong hypotheses** 📊  
- Improve **decision-making & forecasting** 🎯

## 🛠 **How to Conduct ACH**  

### 🔥 **Step 1: Identify Hypotheses**  
- Brainstorm **all possible explanations** for the situation.  
- Ensure **no reasonable hypothesis is ignored**.  

### 🔥 **Step 2: Collect Evidence**  
- Gather **all relevant data** (facts, reports, observations).  
- Include **both confirming & contradicting evidence**.  

### 🔥 **Step 3: Test Each Hypothesis**  
- Create a **matrix** with hypotheses in columns & evidence in rows.  
- Mark how **each piece of evidence supports (+), contradicts (-), or is neutral (0)** for each hypothesis.  

### 🔥 **Step 4: Refine & Adjust**  
- Eliminate hypotheses that are **strongly contradicted** by evidence.  
- Identify **key evidence that differentiates hypotheses**.  

### 🔥 **Step 5: Rank Hypotheses**  
- The **hypothesis least contradicted by evidence** is the most likely.  
- Consider **alternative explanations & missing evidence**.  

### 🔥 **Step 6: Review & Reassess**  
- **Test assumptions** & look for **new data**.  
- **Re-run ACH** if new evidence emerges.

## ⚠️ **Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them**  
- ❌ **Confirmation bias** → Focus on **disproving** hypotheses, not proving them.  
- ❌ **Overlooking weak signals** → Consider **all evidence**, even small inconsistencies.  
- ❌ **Premature elimination of hypotheses** → Keep all **reasonable alternatives** in play.  
- ❌ **Static analysis** → Reassess ACH regularly as **new information appears**.

## 🔧 **Tools for ACH**  
- **🖥️ Digital**: ACH2 Software, Excel, Miro, Google Sheets  
- **📌 Physical**: Whiteboards, Sticky Notes, Decision Matrices

## 🚀 **Example: Identifying the Cause of a Cyberattack**  
**Scenario:** A government agency experiences a **major cybersecurity breach**.  

| Evidence | H1: State-sponsored attack | H2: Insider threat | H3: Random hacker group |
|----------|----------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Sophisticated malware | ✅ Likely | ❌ Unlikely | ✅ Possible |
| No ransom demand | ✅ Expected | ✅ Expected | ❌ Unusual |
| Involves classified data | ✅ Expected | ✅ Expected | ❌ Unlikely |
| No signs of external access | ❌ Unlikely | ✅ Likely | ❌ Unlikely |

✔️ **Outcome:** ACH suggests an **insider threat** is the **most likely** explanation, guiding further investigation.
