## A. ⚡ Quick-Guide (60-Second Scan)

| STEP | WHAT TO CHECK | OK ✅ | RED FLAG 🚫 | ACTION 🛠️ |
| ---- | ------------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- |
| **1. Bias 🎭** | Tone, framing | Balanced, cites both sides | Emotional, “us vs them” | Compare alt-view ✓ |
| **2. Currency ⏳** | Date, live links | ≤ 12 mo old, links work | No date / 404 links | Wayback / newer source |
| **3. Relevance 🎯** | Direct fit? | Answers need | Off-topic, too deep/shallow | Skim other hits |
| **4. Authority 🏅** | Author, domain | Named expert, .edu/.gov | Anonymous blog, ads | Search author bio |
| **5. Accuracy 🛡️** | Evidence | Primary data, references | No sources, stats off | Fact-check 2 refs |
| **6. Purpose 🎯** | Intent, monetization | Inform/educate | Clickbait, hidden ads | Ask “Who gains?” |

> ⏱️ **Rule-of-Thumb:** If ≥ 4 boxes are ✅ → safe to cite. Otherwise keep only as background.

## B. 📜 Full Practical Guide

### 1️⃣ Bias – Identifying Human, AI & Content Tilt 🎭  
- **Self-check first:** note your own stance—confirmation bias is sneaky.  
- **AI bias audit:** paste text into *Sapling AI Bias Detector* or *GPTZero* → skim report.  
- **Emotion test:** if wording triggers anger/fear/tribal pride, slow-read & cross-verify.  
- **Algorithm lens:** switch to incognito + VPN to see how differently search results rank the topic.  
- **Decision prompt:** *“Would I still trust this if it contradicted my view?”*

### 2️⃣ Currency – Timeliness Matters ⏳  
| PRACTICAL TIP | HOW-TO |
| ------------- | ------ |
| **Check publish/updated date** | CTRL + F “202” / “20xx”; if none, suspect stale. |
| **Validate links fast** | Hover + glance at status bar; dead? open Wayback snapshot. |
| **Industry half-life** | Tech/health: refresh ≤ 2 y. History: older OK if seminal. |
| **Stealth edits** | Use *DiffChecker* on saved snapshots. |
| **Alert** | For ongoing topics, set Google Alert with “site:.gov topic” filter. |

---

### 3️⃣ Relevance – Fit for Purpose 🎯  
1. **Define your need** (“I need a 2023 policy benchmark”).  
2. **Run 3-source compare**: academic, trade press, stakeholder org.  
3. **Audience alignment**: if briefing execs, skip PhD jargon; if thesis, prefer peer-reviewed depth.  
4. **Citation test**: would you quote it in a board memo or academic references? If no—replace.  

---

### 4️⃣ Authority – Credentials & Credibility 🏅  
**Rapid drill-down:**  
- **Author** → LinkedIn profile? publications? ORCID?  
- **Host domain** → .gov/.edu > .org > .com > blogspot.  
- **Transparency** → About page lists editorial policy & funding.  
- **AI disclosure** → look for “This article was produced with AI and reviewed by …”.  
- **External endorsements** → cited by another reputable site? Use Google Scholar “Cited by”.  

---

### 5️⃣ Accuracy – Truth & Error Checking 🛡️  
- **Triangulate data**: locate original dataset (e.g., UN, Eurostat).  
- **Math sanity**: divide %, multiply base numbers—quick spreadsheet spot check.  
- **Cross-language compare**: translate headline into another language & back—see if facts survive.  
- **Peer review badge**: journals list reviewer process; blogs rarely do.  
- **Auto-fact-checkers**: *NewsGuard*, *PolitiFact API*, *Snopes* search bar.  
- **Quality signals**: clear graphs, citations, consistent style → higher trust.

### 6️⃣ Purpose – Motivation Behind the Message 🎯  
| SIGNAL | INFORMATIVE 🟢 | PROMOTIONAL 🟠 | MANIPULATIVE 🔴 |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **Disclosure** | Explains funding/conflicts | “Sponsored” small font | Hidden sponsorship |
| **Language** | Neutral, data-driven | Persuasive tone | Fear or outrage bait |
| **Benefit** | Reader gains insight | Seller gains clicks | Actor gains power |

> **Ask:** *“If this is wrong, who loses money or influence?”* — track that trail.
