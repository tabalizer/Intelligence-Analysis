# 🧐 BCRAAP+  
## Source, Information & Evidence Evaluation Cheat Sheet (INTEL-Grade)

**Purpose:**  
A practical, analyst-safe framework for evaluating **sources**, **claims**, and **evidence** under time pressure — with explicit safeguards against deception, influence, and false confidence.

## A. ⚡ 60-Second Quick Gate (Use This First)

**DO NOT SCORE YET. PASS THE GATES.**

### Gate 1 — Evidence Integrity (EI) ❗ *Hard Stop*
- Provenance known?
- First appearance identifiable (who/when/where)?
- No signs of manipulation, re-captioning, or context drift?

**❌ Fail → Do not cite. Background only.**

---

### Gate 2 — Claim Credibility (IC)
- Is the claim **clear and falsifiable**?
- Internally consistent?
- Plausible given known constraints (technical, political, physical)?

Rate: **Low / Medium / High**

---

### Gate 3 — Corroboration & Independence
- Independent confirmation?
- Truly independent (not re-posts, wire reuse, or circular citation)?

Score: **0 / 1 / 2+ independent confirmations**

---

### Gate 4 — Purpose & Incentives
- Who benefits if this is believed?
- Who loses if it is false?
- Any signs of agenda, timing exploitation, or amplification?

Risk: **Low / Medium / High**

---

### 🧠 Decision Rule (Replace “4 green = safe”)
| Outcome | Rule |
|------|-----|
| **Safe to cite** | EI pass AND IC ≥ Medium AND ≥1 independent corroboration |
| **Background only** | EI pass BUT no corroboration OR high purpose risk |
| **Hold / Unverified** | Plausible but immature verification |
| **Discard** | EI fail OR proven manipulation |

## B. 📜 Full Practical Framework (BCRAAP+)

### 1️⃣ Bias — Analyst, Source & System 🎭
- **Analyst self-check:** identify your prior belief.
- **Language scan:** outrage, tribal framing, certainty without data.
- **Algorithm lens:** incognito / alt-language search to surface framing differences.
- **Decision test:** *Would this still persuade me if it contradicted my position?*

⚠️ Note: AI-bias detectors may flag style, **not truth**. Use only as weak triage signals.

---

### 2️⃣ Currency — Time vs Verification Maturity ⏳
- Event time ≠ publication time.
- Fresh ≠ verified.
- High-impact claims demand **verification maturity**, not speed.

Guidance:
- Crisis / conflict: older + verified > newer + viral.
- Tech / health: short half-life.
- History / doctrine: age acceptable if primary/seminal.

---

### 3️⃣ Relevance — Fit for Analytical Task 🎯
- Explicitly define the analytical need.
- Match depth to audience (policy vs technical).
- Ask: *Would I quote this in a decision memo?*

If not → replace.

---

### 4️⃣ Authority — Reliability, Not Prestige 🏅
Evaluate **track record**, not domain suffix.

Check:
- Author history on this topic.
- Access to primary information.
- Correction behavior when wrong.
- Editorial transparency and funding.

⚠️ Design quality ≠ truth. Well-resourced deception exists.

---

### 5️⃣ Accuracy vs Verifiability 🛡️
Separate clearly:
- **Verifiable:** can be independently checked now.
- **Unverified:** plausible but not yet confirmable.
- **False:** contradicted by reliable evidence.

Practices:
- Triangulate to primary datasets.
- Sanity-check numbers.
- Cross-language headline comparison.
- Inspect citations: do they actually support the claim?

---

### 6️⃣ Evidence Integrity — Provenance & Chain of Custody 🔗
Especially critical for OSINT and media.

Ask:
- Original uploader identifiable?
- Metadata consistent?
- Any cropping, recompression, translation, or re-captioning?
- Is the media reused from another event?

Integrity failure = **no citation**, regardless of narrative appeal.

---

### 7️⃣ Purpose & Influence Indicators 🎯
Look for:
- Strategic timing (elections, crises, sanctions).
- Over-certainty (“we can confirm” without method).
- Coordinated amplification across accounts.
- Selective truth that advances a narrative.

Ask:  
*Is this designed to inform — or to steer behavior?*

---

## 🧰 Minimal Tooling (Use Sparingly)

| Category | Tool | Use |
|------|-----|----|
| Archive | Wayback Machine | Deleted / edited pages |
| Image | TinEye | Origin tracing |
| Claims | Google Fact Check Explorer | Prior assessments |
| Data | Official stats portals | Primary verification |
| Notes | Zotero | Tag EI / IC / Risk status |

⚠️ AI-text detectors: **style indicators only**, not truth arbiters.

---

## 📌 30-Second Rescue Routine (When Unsure)
1. Check provenance first.
2. Search claim via `site:.gov OR site:.edu`.
3. Verify largest number or key fact.
4. Reverse-image top media.
5. Strip adjectives from headline — reassess meaning.

If still unclear → **mark unverified or background**.

---

## 🧠 Core Principle (Read This Twice)
> Authority can lie.  
> Virality can mislead.  
> Evidence integrity and independent corroboration are non-negotiable.

**Stay curious. Stay skeptical. Stay BCRAAP+.**
