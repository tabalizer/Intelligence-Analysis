## 🌀 **Cone of Plausibility Cheat Sheet**  

### 📌 **What is the Cone of Plausibility?**  
The **Cone of Plausibility** is a **foresight technique** used to visualize and analyze **multiple possible futures**. It helps analysts **assess trends, uncertainties, and key drivers** to develop **scenarios ranging from expected to wildcard events**.  

### 🎯 **Purpose**  
- Improve **strategic foresight & risk assessment** 🔮  
- Identify **plausible future scenarios** 📊  
- Enhance **decision-making under uncertainty** 🎯  
- Prepare for **unexpected disruptions** ⚠️

## 🛠 **How to Conduct a Cone of Plausibility Analysis**  

### 🔥 **Step 1: Define the Baseline Future**  
- Identify **current trends & expected developments** 📈  
- Assume a **continuation of existing patterns** as the **most probable future**.  

### 🔥 **Step 2: Identify Key Drivers & Uncertainties**  
- List **external forces** (economic, political, social, technological).  
- Rank by **impact & uncertainty**.  

### 🔥 **Step 3: Develop Alternative Scenarios**  
- **Expected Future** – The most probable scenario based on trends ✅  
- **Alternative Plausible Futures** – Diverging but still reasonable outcomes 🔄  
- **Wildcard Scenarios** – Low-probability, high-impact events 🃏  

### 🔥 **Step 4: Map the Cone**  
- **Center**: Expected future (high probability).  
- **Outer edges**: Less likely but plausible futures.  
- **Far outer zone**: Wildcards with high uncertainty.  

### 🔥 **Step 5: Analyze Implications & Strategies**  
- Identify **early warning signs** for each scenario.  
- Develop **contingency plans** for **unexpected outcomes**.

## ⚠️ **Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them**  
- ❌ **Focusing only on expected trends** → Always consider **alternative futures**.  
- ❌ **Overlooking wildcard scenarios** → Low-probability events can have **huge impacts**.  
- ❌ **Assuming the future is linear** → Change is often **disruptive & unpredictable**.  
- ❌ **Failing to update scenarios** → The **cone must evolve** as new data emerges.
