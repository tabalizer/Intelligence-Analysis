## 🌳 **Decision Trees Cheat Sheet**  

### 📌 **What is a Decision Tree?**  
A **Decision Tree** is a **visual decision-making tool** that maps out **choices, possible outcomes, and consequences** in a structured way. It helps **evaluate risks, compare options, and make informed decisions**.  

### 🎯 **Purpose**  
- Break down **complex decisions into manageable steps** 🔍  
- Compare **multiple options & their outcomes** 🎯  
- Assess **risks, probabilities, and expected values** ⚖️  
- Improve **strategic planning & forecasting** 🔮

## 🛠 **How to Build a Decision Tree**  

### 🔥 **Step 1: Define the Decision**  
- Identify the **main problem or choice** to be made.  
- Clearly outline the **possible options**.  

### 🔥 **Step 2: Add Branches for Each Option**  
- Each branch represents a **possible choice**.  
- Include **factors like costs, benefits, and uncertainties**.  

### 🔥 **Step 3: Identify Possible Outcomes**  
- Expand branches to show **potential consequences** of each choice.  
- Consider **both positive and negative outcomes**.  

### 🔥 **Step 4: Assign Probabilities & Values**  
- Estimate **probabilities** for uncertain outcomes.  
- Calculate **expected value (EV)** using:  

  **EV = Probability × Outcome Value**  

### 🔥 **Step 5: Analyze & Choose the Best Path**  
- Compare **expected values** and **risk levels**.  
- Select the **option with the most favorable outcome**.

## ⚠️ **Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them**  
- ❌ **Overcomplicating the tree** → Keep it **clear & focused**.  
- ❌ **Ignoring probabilities** → Use **data to estimate likelihoods**.  
- ❌ **Neglecting alternative factors** → Consider **costs, time, and feasibility**.  
- ❌ **Failing to update analysis** → Reassess as **new information emerges**.
