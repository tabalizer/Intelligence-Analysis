## 🔍 **Key Assumptions Check Cheat Sheet**  

### 📌 **What is Key Assumptions Check?**  
Key Assumptions Check (KAC) is a **structured technique** used to identify and assess the assumptions underlying an analysis. It helps analysts **challenge biases, reduce blind spots, and enhance critical thinking**.  

### 🎯 **Purpose**  
- Identify **hidden assumptions** 🎭  
- Test **validity & reliability** of assumptions ✅  
- Reduce **cognitive bias & analytic errors** ⚠️  
- Strengthen **decision-making & forecasting** 🔮

## 🛠 **How to Conduct a Key Assumptions Check**  

### 🔥 **Step 1: Identify Assumptions**  
- List all **explicit & implicit assumptions** supporting your analysis.  
- Consider **facts, beliefs, and expectations** that shape conclusions.  

### 🔥 **Step 2: Challenge Assumptions**  
- **Why do we believe this?** 🤔  
- **What if this assumption is false?** ❌  
- **What evidence supports or contradicts it?** 🔍  

### 🔥 **Step 3: Categorize Assumptions**  
- **Strong Assumptions** – Well-supported & unlikely to change.  
- **Questionable Assumptions** – Weak evidence or high uncertainty.  
- **High-Risk Assumptions** – If incorrect, analysis collapses.  

### 🔥 **Step 4: Assess the Impact**  
- Prioritize **critical assumptions** affecting outcomes.  
- Adjust conclusions if key assumptions are **weak or invalid**.  
- Consider **alternative scenarios** if major assumptions fail.

## ⚠️ **Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them**  
- ❌ **Assuming without questioning** → Explicitly state all assumptions.  
- ❌ **Ignoring contradictory evidence** → Seek out opposing viewpoints.  
- ❌ **Focusing only on strong assumptions** → Challenge even "obvious" ones.  
- ❌ **Skipping reassessment** → Regularly revisit assumptions as new data emerges.

## 🔧 **Tools for Key Assumptions Check**  
- **🖥️ Digital**: Miro, Trello, MindMeister  
- **📌 Physical**: Whiteboards, Sticky Notes, Checklists

## 🚀 **Example: National Security Threat Assessment**  
**Scenario:** Assessing the risk of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure.  

- **Assumption:** "Our cybersecurity systems are robust and up to date."  
  - **Challenge:** When was the last audit? Are we testing for evolving threats?  
- **Assumption:** "A nation-state actor is responsible for recent attacks."  
  - **Challenge:** Could it be independent hackers or insider threats?  

✔️ Outcome: The analysis shifts to **a broader range of threat actors** and **improving cyber resilience**.
