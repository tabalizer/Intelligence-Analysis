# 🌟 The Known-Unknowns Matrix 🤔

This matrix helps in understanding different levels of knowledge and uncertainty in decision-making.

## 📊 Matrix Overview

| 📌 Knowledge About Occurrence | 🔥 High Impact | 🌊 Low Impact |
|---------------------------|------------|------------|
| **📗 High Knowledge**  | ✅ **Known Knowns**  <br> *Things we are certain of.* | 🤷‍♂️ **Unknown Knowns** <br> *Others know, but you don’t know.* |
| **📕 Low Knowledge**   | ❓ **Known Unknowns**  <br> *We know there are things we can't predict.* | 🚀 **Unknown Unknowns** <br> *We don’t know what we don’t know.* |

## 🎯 Explanation of Each Quadrant

### 1. ✅ **Known Knowns**
   - These are things we are aware of and understand well.
   - **Example:** 🧪 Established scientific facts, 📜 laws of physics.

### 2. ❓ **Known Unknowns**
   - We are aware of their existence, but their exact nature or outcome is uncertain.
   - **Example:** 📉 Future stock market movements, 🌦️ weather conditions.

### 3. 🤷‍♂️ **Unknown Knowns**
   - Knowledge exists, but we are unaware of it.
   - **Example:** 🏢 Organizational knowledge gaps, 🤝 tribal knowledge in teams.

### 4. 🚀 **Unknown Unknowns**
   - Completely unforeseen factors or events.
   - **Example:** 🌍 Unpredictable crises, 💡 emerging technological disruptions.

## 🚀 Applications
- 🛡️ **Risk Management**: Identifying potential uncertainties and mitigating risks.
- 📈 **Strategic Planning**: Allocating resources to areas of uncertainty.
- 💡 **Innovation & Research**: Exploring the unknown to gain a competitive advantage.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Matrix
1. 🔍 **Identify** where different risks or knowledge gaps fit within the matrix.
2. 🎯 **Mitigate** risks by converting unknowns into knowns.
3. 🔄 **Continuously update** as new information becomes available.
