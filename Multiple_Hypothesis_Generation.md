## 📝 **Multiple Hypothesis Generation (MHG) Cheat Sheet**  

### 📌 **What is Multiple Hypothesis Generation?**  
Multiple Hypothesis Generation (MHG) is a **structured technique** used to develop and compare **several possible explanations** for an event or situation. It helps analysts **avoid bias, reduce uncertainty, and improve decision-making** by considering **all reasonable alternatives**.  

### 🎯 **Purpose**  
- Prevent **premature conclusions** 🚫  
- Reduce **confirmation bias** 🎭  
- Explore **alternative explanations** 🔍  
- Improve **critical thinking & analytical rigor** 🧐

## 🛠 **How to Conduct Multiple Hypothesis Generation**  

### 🔥 **Step 1: Define the Problem**  
- Clearly state the **issue, event, or question** under analysis.  
- Gather **relevant data** from multiple sources.  

### 🔥 **Step 2: Generate Multiple Hypotheses**  
- Brainstorm **all possible explanations** for the situation.  
- Include **mainstream, alternative, and outlier hypotheses**.  
- Avoid **favoring a single hypothesis too early**.  

### 🔥 **Step 3: Test & Evaluate Each Hypothesis**  
- Collect **supporting and contradicting evidence** for each.  
- Ask: **What would need to be true for this to be correct?**  
- Look for **gaps, inconsistencies, or missing data**.  

### 🔥 **Step 4: Rank Hypotheses by Likelihood**  
- Eliminate **weak or unsupported** hypotheses.  
- Prioritize **most plausible** explanations.  
- Use techniques like **Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) for deeper evaluation**.  

### 🔥 **Step 5: Monitor & Reassess**  
- Regularly **update the analysis** with new data.  
- Stay open to **shifting probabilities** as evidence evolves.

## ⚠️ **Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them**  
- ❌ **Anchoring bias** → Avoid fixating on a single hypothesis.  
- ❌ **Ignoring weak signals** → Consider low-probability but high-impact possibilities.  
- ❌ **Overcomplicating analysis** → Focus on the **most relevant hypotheses**.  
- ❌ **Failure to revisit conclusions** → Regularly update based on new data.

## 🔧 **Tools for Multiple Hypothesis Generation**  
- **🖥️ Digital**: Miro, Trello, Google Docs, Mind Mapping Software  
- **📌 Physical**: Whiteboards, Sticky Notes, Flowcharts

## 🚀 **Example: Investigating an Economic Crisis**  
**Scenario:** Analyzing a sudden market downturn 📉  

| Hypothesis | Supporting Evidence | Contradicting Evidence |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **H1: Global supply chain issues** | Reports of delayed shipments | Some industries unaffected |
| **H2: Speculative trading bubble burst** | Rapid stock sell-offs | No major asset crash signals |
| **H3: Cyberattack on financial systems** | Unusual network activity | No breach confirmations |
| **H4: Government policy changes** | New tax regulations | No immediate policy impact |

✔️ Outcome: By evaluating multiple hypotheses, analysts **gain a more complete understanding of the crisis and its possible causes**.
