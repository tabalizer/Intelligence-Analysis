# 🔮 Scenario Planning Cheat Sheet  

## 📌 What is Scenario Planning?  
Scenario Planning is a **foresight technique** used to create **multiple plausible future scenarios** based on key uncertainties and trends. It helps organizations **prepare for change, reduce risk, and develop long-term strategies**.  

## 🎯 Purpose  
- Anticipate **future uncertainties & disruptions** 🔍  
- Test **strategies against different possible futures** ⚖️  
- Improve **risk management & decision-making** 🎯  
- Enhance **long-term planning & adaptability** 🔮

## 🛠 How to Conduct Scenario Planning  

### 🔥 Step 1: Define the Focus Area  
- Identify the **decision, trend, or issue** you are planning for.  
- Set a **timeframe** (e.g., 5, 10, or 20 years).  

### 🔥 Step 2: Identify Key Drivers & Uncertainties  
- Determine **external forces** (economic, technological, political, social).  
- Rank **drivers by impact & uncertainty**.  
- Focus on **high-impact, high-uncertainty** factors.  

### 🔥 Step 3: Develop Scenario Frameworks  
- Create a **2x2 matrix** with two key uncertainties as axes.  
- Label each quadrant with **a distinct scenario**.  

### 🔥 Step 4: Build Detailed Scenarios  
- Describe **how each scenario unfolds** over time.  
- Identify **risks, opportunities, and indicators** for each scenario.  
- Develop **stories or narratives** for realism.  

### 🔥 Step 5: Analyze Implications & Strategies  
- Assess **how each scenario affects your organization**.  
- Develop **contingency plans** for different outcomes.  
- Monitor **early warning signs** that indicate a scenario is emerging.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them  
- ❌ **Focusing only on likely futures** → Consider **wildcards & black swans**.  
- ❌ **Ignoring weak signals** → Emerging trends can **reshape industries**.  
- ❌ **Static thinking** → Regularly **update scenarios as conditions change**.  
- ❌ **Using too many scenarios** → Limit to **3-4 strong, distinct futures**.

## 🔧 Tools for Scenario Planning  
- **🖥️ Digital**: Miro, Lucidchart, Kumu, Microsoft Excel  
- **📌 Physical**: Whiteboards, Sticky Notes, Strategy Workshops

| Scenario                  | Description                                  | Implications                                     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Green Boom**            | Fast innovation, strong policies             | Huge growth in renewables, energy independence ⚡ |
| **Government-led Green**  | Strict policies but slow tech                | High costs, reliance on subsidies ⚖️             |
| **Innovation**            | Rapid tech growth, weak policies             | Private sector dominates, uneven adoption 🚀     |
| **Fossil Fuel Stagnation** | No strong policy or innovation              | Continued reliance on fossil fuels 🛢️            |
```

✔️ **Outcome:** Companies prepare **flexible strategies** based on which scenario unfolds.
